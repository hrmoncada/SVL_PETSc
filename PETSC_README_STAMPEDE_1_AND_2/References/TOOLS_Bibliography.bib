	abstract = {This chapter introduces the tools and methodologies that can be used to engineer the dispersion and anisotropy of periodic electromagnetic structures. The theory and concepts are presented in language that is as simple as possible, so the information will be useful and interesting to a wide audience. The history and motivation for the topic is given in Section 1 followed by a review of 3D printing and solid-state electromagnetics. Three simple but powerful numerical methods are presented for analyzing and designing periodic structures. The plane wave expansion method is the dominant technique for calculating electromagnetic modes in periodic structures, particularly those composed of only dielectrics. The finite-difference frequency-domain method is highly versatile and is formulated in this chapter to model scattering from complex anisotropic objects in two dimensions. The last numerical method is a technique to spatially vary, or functionally grade, any of the attributes of a periodic structure while minimizing deformations and preventing defects. This tool can be used to “bend” lattices without changing the size and shape of the unit cells, which could destroy the electromagnetic properties. Next, concepts and methodologies are presented for anisotropic structures such as improving electromagnetic compatibility by sculpting near-fields using spatially variant anisotropic metamaterials. Lastly, concepts and methodologies for engineering the dispersion in periodic structures are presented. Effects such as self-collimation and negative refraction are discussed. Spatially variant self-collimation is introduced as a powerful means to control the flow of electromagnetic beams along arbitrary paths. The chapter concludes with a brief summary and suggests some topics for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Spatial transforms are a popular technique for designing periodic structures that are macroscopically inhomogeneous. The structures are often required to be anisotropic, provide a magnetic response, and to have extreme values for the constitutive parameters in Maxwell's equations. Metamaterials and photonic crystals are capable of providing these, although sometimes only approximately. The problem still remains about how to generate the geometry of the final lattice when it is functionally graded, or spatially varied. This paper describes a simple numerical technique to spatially vary any periodic structure while minimizing deformations to the unit cells that would weaken or destroy the electromagnetic properties. New developments in this algorithm are disclosed that increase efficiency, improve the quality of the lattices and provide the ability to design aplanatic metasurfaces. The ability to spatially vary a lattice in this manner enables new design paradigms that are not possible using spatial transforms, three of which are discussed here. First, spatially variant self-collimating photonic crystals are shown to flow unguided waves around very tight bends using ordinary materials with low refractive index. Second, multi-mode waveguides in spatially variant band gap materials are shown to guide waves around bends without mixing power between the modes. Third, spatially variant anisotropic materials are shown to sculpt the near-field around electric components. This can be used to improve electromagnetic compatibility between components in close proximity.},
