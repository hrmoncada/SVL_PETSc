This release of ScaLAPACK extends the functionality of the package by providing new routines for the nonsymmetric eigenproblem, divide and conquer symmetric eigenproblem, and improved routines for generalized symmetric eigenproblem and the reduction to tridiagonal form. It also includes PBLAS v2.0. These two-dimensional distributed memory versions of common LAPACK routines rely on calls to the BLAS for local computation, and calls to the PBLAS for global computations. For portability concerns, communication takes place inside the PBLAS through calls to the BLACS. The design of the testing/timing programs for the ScaLAPACK codes is also discussed.}

	abstract = {The manycore revolution in computational hardware can be characterized by increasing thread counts, decreasing memory per thread, and architecture specific performance constraints for memory access patterns. High performance computing (HPC) on emerging many core architectures requires codes to exploit every opportunity for thread-level parallelism and satisfy conflicting performance constraints. We developed the Kokkos C++ library to provide scientific and engineering codes with a user accessible many core performance portable programming model. The two foundational abstractions of Kokkos are (1) dispatch work to a many core device for parallel execution and (2) manage multidimensional arrays with polymorphic layouts. The integration of these abstractions enables users' code to satisfy multiple architecture specific memory access pattern performance constraints without having to modify their source code. In this paper we describe the Kokkos abstractions, summarize its application programmer 
interface (API), and present performance results for a molecular dynamics computational kernel and finite element mini-application.},
