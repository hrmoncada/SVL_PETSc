	abstract = {Fundamentals of Algorithms 2 Computational scientists often encounter problems requiring the solution of sparse systems of linear equations. Attacking these problems efficiently requires an in-depth knowledge of the underlying theory, algorithms, and data structures found in sparse matrix software libraries. Here, Davis presents the fundamentals of sparse matrix algorithms to provide the requisite background. The book includes CSparse, a concise downloadable sparse matrix package that illustrates the algorithms and theorems presented in the book and equips readers with the tools necessary to understand larger and more complex software packages. With a strong emphasis on MATLAB® and the C programming language, Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems equips readers with the working knowledge required to use sparse solver packages and write code to interface applications to those packages. The book also explains how MATLAB performs its sparse matrix computations. This invaluable book is essential to computational scientists and software developers who want to understand the theory and algorithms behind modern techniques used to solve large sparse linear systems. The book also serves as an excellent practical resource for students with an interest in combinatorial scientific computing.

	abstract = {This is a concise, insightful introduction to the field of numerical linear algebra. The clarity and eloquence of the presentation make it popular with teachers and students alike. The text aims to expand the reader's view of the field and to present standard material in a novel way. All of the most important topics in the field are covered with a fresh perspective, including iterative methods for systems of equations and eigenvalue problems and the underlying principles of conditioning and stability. Presentation is in the form of 40 lectures, which each focus on one or two central ideas. The unity between topics is emphasized throughout, with no risk of getting lost in details and technicalities. The book breaks with tradition by beginning with the QR factorization - an important and fresh idea for students, and the thread that connects most of the algorithms of numerical linear algebra.

	title = {Performance evaluation for petascale quantum simulation tools},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper describes the performance evaluation and analysis of a set of open source petascale quantum simulation tools for nanotechnology applications. The tools of interest are based on the existing realspace multigrid (RMG) method. In this work we take a reference set of these tools and evaluate their performance with the help of performance evaluation libraries and tools such as TAU and PAPI. The goal is to develop an in-depth understanding of their performance on Teraflop leadership platforms, and moreover identify possible bottlenecks and give suggestions for their removal. The measurements are being done on ORNL’s Cray XT4 system (Jaguar) based on quad-core 2.1 GHz AMD Opteron processors. Profiling is being used to identify possible performance bottlenecks and tracing is being used to try to determine the exact locations and causes of those bottlenecks. The results so far indicate that the methodology followed can be used to easily produce and analyze performance data, and that this ability has the potential to aid our overall efforts on developing efficient quantum simulation tools for petascale systems.

The invariance property of the Krylov subspace is used to solve the resulting large sparse complex symmetric linear system. To improve iteration convergence the pseudo inverse of the coefficient matrix is employed when constructing the Krylov subspace instead of the coefficient matrix itself. In each iteration four 3D Poisson equations are computed to get a new Lanczos vector with the incomplete Cholesky decomposition conjugate method. Generally the desirable solution is achieved with the iteration less than 20 times. Also, a new material averaging formula is proposed to get a reasonable average of the conductivity, which guarantees the conservation of the electric current.},

	abstract = {It is often desired to functionally grade and/or spatially vary a periodic structure like a photonic crystal or metamaterial, yet no general method for doing this has been offered in the literature. A straightforward procedure is described here that allows many properties of the lattice to be spatially varied at the same time while producing a final lattice that is still smooth and continuous. Properties include unit cell orientation, lattice spacing, fill fraction, and more. This adds many degrees of freedom to a design such as spatially varying the orientation to exploit directional phenomena. The method is not a coordinate transformation technique so it can more easily produce complicated and arbitrary spatial variance. To demonstrate, the algorithm is used to synthesize a spatially variant self-collimating photonic crystal to flow a Gaussian beam around a 90° bend. The performance of the structure was confirmed through simulation and it showed virtually no scattering around the bend that would have arisen if the lattice had defects or discontinuities.},

The method consists of two steps which are: numerical synthesis of corresponding phase mask by employing a two-dimensional integrated gradient calculations and experimental implementation of synthesized phase mask by making use of a phase only spatial light modulator in an optical 4f Fourier filtering setup. As a working example, we provide the experimental fabrication of a spatially variant square lattice structure which has the possibility to guide a Gaussian beam through a 90° bend by photonic crystal self-collimation phenomena. The method is digitally reconfigurable, is completely scalable, and could be extended to other kind of lattices as well.},

These large systems are represented by matrix equations including highly sparse coefficient matrices, and they can often only be solved by using iterative methods. This paper presents an algorithm in which the matrix-equation solution approach in an iterative method is replaced by a multi-step solution process. Instead of using a coefficient matrix, the coefficients in the FDFD formulations are kept as three-dimensional arrays, and they are treated as operators. The algorithm is used together with the Bi-Conjugate Gradients Stabilized (BICGSTAB) method. This is applied to a three-dimensional FDFD method to solve for scattering from dielectric objects. It is also applied to two other FDFD methods (a single-grid and a double-grid FDFD) to solve for scattering from chiral objects. It has been shown that the presented algorithm effectively reduces the solution time and memory requirements.},

This can arise when devices must be considered with realistic geometry or when they contain artificial materials such as photonic crystals, left-handed materials, nanoparticles, or other metamaterials. The slice absorption method (SAM) was developed to address this need. The method is fully numerical and able to break large problems down into small pieces, or slices, using matrix division or Gaussian elimination instead of eigensystem computations and scattering matrix manipulations. In these regards, the SAM is an attractive alternative to popular techniques like the finite-difference time domain method, rigorous coupled-wave analysis, and the transfer matrix method. To demonstrate the utility of the SAM and benchmark its accuracy, reflection was simulated for a photonic crystal fabricated in SU-8 by multiphoton direct laser writing. Realistic geometry was incorporated into the model by simulating the microfabrication process, which yielded simulation results that matched experimental measurements remarkably well.},
