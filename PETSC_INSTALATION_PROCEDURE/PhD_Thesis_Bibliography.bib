	abstract = {The finite difference method based on staggered grids is applied to simulate the induction logging response in {3D} media. The invariance property of the Krylov subspace is used to solve the resulting large sparse complex symmetric linear system. To improve iteration convergence the pseudo inverse of the coefficient matrix is employed when constructing the Krylov subspace instead of the coefficient matrix itself. In each iteration four {3D} Poisson equations are computed to get a new Lanczos vector with the incomplete Cholesky decomposition conjugate method. Generally the desirable solution is achieved with the iteration less than 20 times. Also, a new material averaging formula is proposed to get a reasonable average of the conductivity, which guarantees the conservation of the electric current.},

	abstract = {Finite-Difference Frequency-Domain methods ({FDFD)} require solution of large linear systems of equations. These large systems are represented by matrix equations including highly sparse coefficient matrices, and they can often only be solved by using iterative methods. This paper presents an algorithm in which the matrix-equation solution approach in an iterative method is replaced by a multi-step solution process. Instead of using a coefficient matrix, the coefficients in the {FDFD} formulations are kept as three-dimensional arrays, and they are treated as operators. The algorithm is used together with the Bi-Conjugate Gradients Stabilized ({BICGSTAB)} method. This is applied to a three-dimensional {FDFD} method to solve for scattering from dielectric objects. It is also applied to two other {FDFD} methods (a single-grid and a double-grid {FDFD)} to solve for scattering from chiral objects. It has been shown that the presented algorithm effectively reduces the solution time and memory 
requirements.},

This can arise when devices must be considered with realistic geometry or when they contain artificial materials such as photonic crystals, left-handed materials, nanoparticles, or other metamaterials. The slice absorption method ({SAM)} was developed to address this need. The method is fully numerical and able to break large problems down into small pieces, or slices, using matrix division or Gaussian elimination instead of eigensystem computations and scattering matrix manipulations. In these regards, the {SAM} is an attractive alternative to popular techniques like the finite-difference time domain method, rigorous coupled-wave analysis, and the transfer matrix method. To demonstrate the utility of the {SAM} and benchmark its accuracy, reflection was simulated for a photonic crystal fabricated in {SU-8} by multiphoton direct laser writing. 
Realistic geometry was incorporated into the model by simulating the microfabrication process, which yielded simulation results that matched experimental measurements remarkably well.},

A straightforward procedure is described here that allows many properties of the lattice to be spatially varied at the same time while producing a final lattice that is still smooth and continuous. Properties include unit cell orientation, lattice spacing, fill fraction, and more. This adds many degrees of freedom to a design such as spatially varying the orientation to exploit directional phenomena. The method is not a coordinate transformation technique so it can more easily produce complicated and arbitrary spatial variance. To demonstrate, the algorithm is used to synthesize a spatially variant self-collimating photonic crystal to flow a Gaussian beam around a 90{\textdegree} bend. The performance of the structure was confirmed through simulation and it showed virtually no scattering around the 
	bend that would have arisen if the lattice had defects or discontinuities.}

	abstract = {Spatial transforms are a popular technique for designing periodic structures that are macroscopically inhomogeneous. The structures are often required to be anisotropic, provide a magnetic response, and to have extreme values for the constitutive parameters in Maxwell's equations. Metamaterials and photonic crystals are capable of providing these, although sometimes only approximately. The problem still remains about how to generate the geometry of the final lattice when it is functionally graded, or spatially varied. This paper describes a simple numerical technique to spatially vary any periodic structure while minimizing deformations to the unit cells that would weaken or destroy the electromagnetic properties. New developments in this algorithm are disclosed that increase efficiency, improve the quality of the lattices and provide the ability to design aplanatic metasurfaces. The ability to spatially vary a lattice in this manner enables new design paradigms that are not possible using 
spatial transforms, three of which are discussed here. First, spatially variant self-collimating photonic crystals are shown to flow unguided waves around very tight bends using ordinary materials with low refractive index. Second, multi-mode waveguides in spatially variant band gap materials are shown to guide waves around bends without mixing power between the modes. Third, spatially variant anisotropic materials are shown to sculpt the near-field around electric components. This can be used to improve electromagnetic compatibility between components in close proximity.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces the tools and methodologies that can be used to engineer the dispersion and anisotropy of periodic electromagnetic structures. The theory and concepts are presented in language that is as simple as possible, so the information will be useful and interesting to a wide audience. The history and motivation for the topic is given in Section 1 followed by a review of 3D printing and solid-state electromagnetics. Three simple but powerful numerical methods are presented for analyzing and designing periodic structures. The plane wave expansion method is the dominant technique for calculating electromagnetic modes in periodic structures, particularly those composed of only dielectrics. The finite-difference frequency-domain method is highly versatile and is formulated in this chapter to model scattering from complex anisotropic objects in two dimensions. The last numerical method is a technique to spatially vary, or functionally grade, any of the attributes of a periodic 
structure while minimizing deformations and preventing defects. This tool can be used to “bend” lattices without changing the size and shape of the unit cells, which could destroy the electromagnetic properties. Next, concepts and methodologies are presented for anisotropic structures such as improving electromagnetic compatibility by sculpting near-fields using spatially variant anisotropic metamaterials. Lastly, concepts and methodologies for engineering the dispersion in periodic structures are presented. Effects such as self-collimation and negative refraction are discussed. Spatially variant self-collimation is introduced as a powerful means to control the flow of electromagnetic beams along arbitrary paths. The chapter concludes with a brief summary and suggests some topics for future research in this area.},

As a working example, we provide the experimental fabrication of a spatially variant square lattice structure which has the possibility to guide a Gaussian beam through a 90° bend by photonic crystal self-collimation phenomena.

The book includes CSparse, a concise downloadable sparse matrix package that illustrates the algorithms and theorems presented in the book and equips readers with the tools necessary to understand larger and more complex software packages. With a strong emphasis on MATLAB® and the C programming language, Direct Methods for Sparse Linear Systems equips readers with the working knowledge required to use sparse solver packages and write code to interface applications to those packages. The book also explains how MATLAB performs its sparse matrix computations. This invaluable book is essential 
to computational scientists and software developers who want to understand the theory and algorithms behind modern techniques used to solve large sparse linear systems.

It also includes PBLAS v2.0. These two-dimensional distributed memory versions of common LAPACK routines rely on calls to the BLAS for local computation, and calls to the PBLAS for global computations. For portability concerns, communication takes place inside the PBLAS through calls to the BLACS. The design of the testing/timing programs for the ScaLAPACK codes is also discussed.}

Also several different classes of special materials are identified as candidates for metamaterials and their particular characteristics are discussed. Finally it is pointed out that the boundary between “ordinary” materials and metamaterials is difficult to draw because also many everyday natural materials are dielectric mixtures which may display very surprising and non-linear macroscopic response functions.}

High performance computing (HPC) on emerging many core architectures requires codes to exploit every opportunity for thread-level parallelism and satisfy conflicting performance constraints. We developed the Kokkos C++ library to provide scientific and engineering codes with a user accessible many core performance portable programming model. The two foundational abstractions of Kokkos are (1) dispatch work to a many core device for parallel execution and (2) manage multidimensional arrays with polymorphic layouts. The integration of these abstractions enables users' code to satisfy multiple architecture specific memory access pattern performance constraints without having to modify their source code. In this paper we describe the Kokkos abstractions, summarize its application programmer 
interface (API), and present performance results for a molecular dynamics computational kernel and finite element mini-application.},
